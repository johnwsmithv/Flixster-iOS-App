#  Flixster Assignment 1
In this app we were tasked with making a simple UI that uses the Flixster API; we are pulling down movies that are currently in theaters. The rows are recycled as we scroll for the sole purpose of reducing the memory usage of the program.

We are pulling down a movie poster, the movie title and a short description of the movie.
