#  Flixster Assignment 1
In this app we were tasked with making a simple UI that uses the Flixster API; we are pulling down movies that are currently in theaters. The rows are recycled as we scroll for the sole purpose of reducing the memory usage of the program.

We are pulling down a movie poster, the movie title and a short description of the movie.

# Flixter Week 2
This week, we added a movie details view controller; when you click on a movie, it goes to that view controller, and it includes a backdrop, poster, the title and a short description. Along with that, I added in tabs, so we can see the movies currently playing and superhero movies similar to Wonder Woman.
